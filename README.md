# liri-node-app

"Deployed" here: https://nickprather11.github.io/liri-node-app/. Not sure this is necessary as it's a node app.

The LIRI node app is used to search for info on movies, songs, and concerts. It makes use of the OMDB, Spotify, and Bandsintown API's to acheive this.

To search for info, after entering "node" and the file name, you must enter a command from the following choices: "movie-this", "spotify-this-song", or "concert-this", followed by the movie, song title, or band/musician you wish to search for. Alternatively, you can also use the command "do-what-it-says" to search for whatever is entered in the random.txt file in the following format: "command,title to search for", excluding the quotations.

Example images of commands and responses can be found in the images folder.
